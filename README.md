# Charge Transfer Distance and Transferred Charge Calculation

This repository provides a Python script to calculate the **Charge Transfer Distance (DCT)** and the **Transferred Charge (qCT)** from Gaussian cube files. It is designed to facilitate research in computational chemistry by automating the calculation of important charge transfer parameters from quantum chemical results.

## Features

- Computes **Charge Transfer Distance (DCT)** between ground and excited states.
- Computes **Transferred Charge (qCT)**.
- Outputs **centroids** of positive and negative density changes for further visualization.
- Supports parallel execution using **multithreading** for faster computation on large cube files.

## Dependencies

To run this script, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- `concurrent.futures` (included with Python 3)
- Gaussian software for generating cube files

You can install the Python dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Gaussian Cube File Preparation with `cubegen`

The script works with **Gaussian cube files** for ground and excited state electron densities. These files can be generated using **Gaussian software**. To generate cube files, you can use the following commands:

### Step 1: Run the Calculation

First, perform a density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculation using Gaussian to generate the checkpoint (.chk) file.

### Step 2: Generate Cube Files

Once you have the checkpoint file, use **`cubegen`** to generate the cube files for both the ground and excited states:

```bash
cubegen 0 density=scf ground_state.chk ground_state.cube -3 h
cubegen 0 density=transition excited_state.chk excited_state.cube -3 h
```

- `density=scf`: Specifies the type of density to extract (e.g., ground state).
- `density=transition`: Specifies the density for the excited state.
- `ground_state.chk` / `excited_state.chk`: The checkpoint files from Gaussian calculations.
- `ground_state.cube` / `excited_state.cube`: Output cube files.

Make sure that the cube files for both ground and excited states have **identical grid sizes** for successful calculation.

## Usage

The Python script uses command line arguments to specify input files and an optional output file. Here's how you can use it:

### Running the Script

```bash
python calculate_dct_qct.py <ground_state_file> <excited_state_file> [--output_file <output_file>]
```

### Example Command

```bash
python calculate_dct_qct.py ground_state.cube excited_state.cube --output_file results.txt
```

- `<ground_state_file>`: Path to the cube file representing the ground state density.
- `<excited_state_file>`: Path to the cube file representing the excited state density.
- `[--output_file <output_file>]`: (Optional) Path to the output file for storing results. If not provided, defaults to `results.txt`.

### Outputs

The script outputs:

1. **Charge Transfer Distance (DCT)**: The distance between the centroids of positive and negative charge densities.
2. **Transferred Charge (qCT)**: The total amount of charge transferred during the excitation.
3. **Centroids of Positive and Negative Density Changes** (`R+` and `R-`): Coordinates of positive and negative density centroids.

The results are also saved in the specified output file in a structured format for easy reference and later use.

### Example Output

```
=============================================
Results for files: 
Ground State File: ground_state.cube
Excited State File: excited_state.cube
Charge Transfer Distance (DCT): 12.34 Ã…
Transferred Charge (qCT): 0.78 e
Centroid of Positive Density Changes (R+): [2.34 1.23 0.98]
Centroid of Negative Density Changes (R-): [5.67 4.56 3.45]
